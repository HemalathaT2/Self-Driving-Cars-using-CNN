# Self-Driving-Cars-using-CNN

1. I have used the open source Self driving car simulator provided by Udacity that is used in their Self driving car Nano degree program. 
2. Using this simulator I first drove the car and collected data. 
3. Later I have trained a CNN model to learn this behavior and then test it back on the simulator. 
4. The model I have used was proposed by NVIDIA. 
5. They used this model to train a real car data and got promising results when they drove it autonomously.
